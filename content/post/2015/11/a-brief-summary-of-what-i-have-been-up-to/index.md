Since my last blog post I have spent some time refining some of my design artifacts. This took a good chunk of time, but it was well worth doing.

## Here is a quick rundown...

### Personae

I now have personae for academic staff, a student and a support staff person for university-x. I also have also devised a persona for an external user.

### Scenarios

I used the Task Scenario template that the module leader provided to us as a starting point and developed eight scenarios for my users.

### Hierarchical task breakdown

I put this into my last post, but here it is again for reference.

The next step is to work from the scenarios to build a UML diagram. That is my aim before Friday.
