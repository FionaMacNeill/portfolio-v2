A bit more on this to [follow on from my last entry](http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog/2016/12/24/on-the-importance-of-self-discipline/#skipinfo) and to provide my references. I added a _skip to content_ link as part of my development of the core navigation in the site. This is assist those who use screen readers of navigate via keyboard. I was prompted to do this based on my previous experience with accessibility requirements and based on advice in the _Inclusive Design Patterns_ book (Pickering, 2016). This was not as simple to accomplish as you might think and the resulting function behaves differently in each browser, however regardless the "skip" option is part of the tab-index as should enhance the navigation of the site. Here is how it works in Chrome - not aesthetically pleasing, but satisfies the requirement. The video shows what happens when the user visits the page and presses the tab key, this reveals the skip to content button. \[video width="324" height="258" mp4="http://www.fionamacneill.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2016-12-27\_19-29-04.mp4"\]\[/video\]
