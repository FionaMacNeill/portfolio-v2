It has been a busy week as I was preparing to give a talk on one of my earlier UX design projects where I looked at how a user's trust could be gained (or lost) through aspects of interface design. I am associated with the [SenSe Research Cluster](http://www.sense-brighton.eu) and it was a fantastic honour to be asked to talk about my project (especially as I am a humble MSc student). If you would like to know more about my project then I have a full write up at my main blog: [http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog/2016/06/14/trust-in-iot-app-interfaces-redux/](http://fionamacneill.co.uk/blog/2016/06/14/trust-in-iot-app-interfaces-redux/ "link to main blog").
